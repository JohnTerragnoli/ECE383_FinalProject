# ECE383_FinalProject


#Problem History
1. ERROR:NgdBuild:604 - logical block 'fsm' with type 'Final_fsm_a' could not be
   resolved. A pin name misspelling can cause this, a missing edif or ngc file,
   case mismatch between the block name and the edif or ngc file name, or the
   misspelling of a type name. Symbol 'Final_fsm_a' is not supported in target
   'spartan6'.
why is this occuring?  Happens whenever an output in a specific module is not designated in the module.  Like assign output <= "0000" just to have this in the begin statement so you stop getting this error while you're hooking everything up.

Lengths: The bit lengths of the signals cannot be designated in the schematic above; I could not figure out how to do this with the software I was using.  Additionally, Iâ€™m not sure exactly how large I would like the signals to be, so much of the following are generous assumptions.  

-	colIndex  = 10 bits unsigned
-	rowIndex = 10 bits unsigned
-	LUTvalue = 2 bits unsigned
-	whatOn = 2 bits std_logic_vector
-	row = 10 bits unsigned
-	column = 10 bits unsigned.  
-	Cw = 5 bits std_logic_vector
-	Sw = 3 bits std_logic_vector
-	Tdms = 3 bits std_logic_vector
-	Tdmsb = 3 bits std_logic_vector
-	IR Signal = 1 bit std_logic
-	Btns = 5 bits std_logic_vector


##Unit Test Plan

In order to successfully complete Milestone 1, the following tasks have to be finished.

-	Get the grid to show up 
-	Create a testbench for the FSM to ensure that it is running and outputting as expected.  
-	Be able to read appropriate values from the LUT and display them on the screen.  Test this by filling the LUT with predetermined values and seeing if they are displayed as expected.  


**Get Grid to Appear**

The first option was very easy to accomplish, as this was largely taken from Lab02 functionality, except the hash marks were removed.

**Begin Finite State Machine (FSM)**

The testbench was made for the FSM, which was built according to the schematic shown in the [Detailed Architecture](https://github.com/JohnTerragnoli/ECE383_FinalProject/blob/master/README.md#detailed-architecture) section.  This construction is rudimentary, however, and will likely be changed as more is created within the datapath.  The screenshot of the operational FSM machine can be seen below:

The states change according to the input just as the FSM schematic [above](https://github.com/JohnTerragnoli/ECE383_FinalProject/blob/master/README.md#detailed-architecture) describes.  




**Read Stored Value and Draw on Monitor**

The third objective was slightly more difficult to achieve.  

1. First, the correct signals needed to be passed from the scopeface module, where pixels are assigned and drawn, to the datapath to be able to assign them specific colors based on game inputs.  This was done with ease and according to the picture of the datapath created in the plan. 
2. Next, the logic for determining the row and column indexes of the grid was created.  A testbench was created to ensure that the correct indexes were being referenced when running through all of the rows and columns.  An two instances of the output are shown below: 


A visual representation of what indexes should appear with what pixels is shown below: 

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnTerragnoli/ECE383_FinalProject/master/Pictures/GridMap_1.JPG "gridMap")

When referencing the pixel at row = 75 and column = 104, the appropriate indexes of 1 and 1 for the row and column are output.  

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnTerragnoli/ECE383_FinalProject/master/Pictures/Index%20Proof%201.PNG "correct column shows up")

When referencing the pixel at row = 125 and column = 11, the index of 15 is used for each.  15 will be tied to the value 0 in the LUT, which will produce the color black.  This case shows that when either the row or the column or both are off the grid then it will only produce black on the screen.

NOTE: to achieve these simulation results, the pixel clock had to be replaced with the clk signal in the vga instatiation.  With the pixel clock in place, row and column would always get returned as UUUUUUUUUU.  


To see if the indexes could be used to draw on specific spaces, the following code was written in the datapath.  It is supposed to write a blue square at the index (1,1) and a red square at (1,2), where the index is (row,column).  

```
whatOn <= 
	"0001" when ((rowIndex = "0001") and (colIndex = "0001")) else
	"0010" when ((rowIndex = "0001") and (colIndex = "0010")) else
	"0000"; 
```

The output of this code can be seen below.  It is exactly what was expected.

Then, this same function was done using BRAM as the LUT.  Values were preloaded into BRAM and fed into the whatOn signal based on the appropriate index of the grid.  The code usd to create a checkered pattern can be seen below: 

```
sampleMemory: BRAM_SDP_MACRO

		port map (
			DO => whatOn_18,					-- Output read data port, width defined by READ_WIDTH parameter
			RDADDR => std_logic_vector(RdAddr),		-- Input address, width defined by port depth
			RDCLK => clk,	 				-- 1-bit input clock
			RST => (not reset),				-- active high reset
			RDEN => '1',					-- read enable 
			REGCE => '1',					-- 1-bit input read output register enable - ignored
			DI => X"0000" & std_logic_vector(whoseTurn),	-- Input data port, width defined by WRITE_WIDTH parameter
			WE => "11",						-- since RAM is byte read, this determines high or low byte
			WRADDR => std_logic_vector(WrAddr),		-- Input write address, width defined by write port depth
			WRCLK => clk,		 			-- 1-bit input write clock
			WREN => '0');				-- 1-bit input write port enable
```


This created the desired checkered output on the monitor, as seen in the picture below:
